Steps Involved
1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Cleaned the raw data:
Removed duplicate entries.
Renamed columns for clarity.
Replaced shortforms with more readable terms to improve comprehension.
2. Data Processing Tool

Note: You can replicate the process using other tools you're comfortable with (e.g., Python, SQL, Excel, etc.).
3. Visualization
Created a Pivot Table to aggregate and summarize key metrics.
Added charts using the Recommended Charts feature in Excel to visualize trends.
Visualizations include:
Average income by gender.
Bike purchases based on commute distance and age brackets.
4. Dashboard Creation
Designed an appealing and user-friendly dashboard layout.
Added interactive elements and clean formatting for better presentation.
